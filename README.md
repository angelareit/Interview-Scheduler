# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application (SPA) built using React. Users can view, book, edit and delete interviews within certain days available. Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database. The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format. Jest tests and cyprus are used for end-to-end and integration testing.
